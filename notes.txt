Might need to roll back to python 2.7 to make it work with my ROS opencv. Scratch this I dont need openCV at the moment

It appears that the QImage class is better than the QPixmap in instances where you are manipulating and changing the pixels/. This is our use case as we are hoping to roate and skew images
Here is some documentation regarding that http://blog.qt.io/blog/2009/12/16/qt-graphics-and-performance-an-overview/ 

Trying to work out where to use Qpainter and the paintEvent. This looks to be a callback that updates the display.
When i use Qpaint does that mean i dont need Qlabel? 
Also how do QPixmap and Qimage fit into this equation?
